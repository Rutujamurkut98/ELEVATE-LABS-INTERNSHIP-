# 🧮 Task 1 - Java Console Calculator
---

## 📌 Task Objective

Create a simple calculator using Java that performs basic operations via console input:

- ➕ Addition  
- ➖ Subtraction  
- ✖️ Multiplication  
- ➗ Division  

The program continuously runs using a loop and performs operations based on user input through the console.

## 🛠️ Features

- Takes user input using `Scanner`
- Uses `switch` statement for selecting the operation
- Supports:
  - Integer inputs
  - Loop until user chooses to exit
- Handles invalid input gracefully

## 💻 How to Run

1. Open the file in any Java IDE (like VS Code, IntelliJ, Eclipse) or terminal.
2. Compile the Java program:
   ```bash
   javac Calculator.java


# 📘 Task 2 - Student Record Management System

**Java Developer Internship Tasks – Daily code submissions, solutions, and learnings from the Elevate Labs Internship Program.**

## 📌 Task Objective

Create a **Java-based Student Record Management System** that allows users to:

- ➕ Add Student Record  
- 👁️ View All Student Records (in table format)  
- ✏️ Update Student Record (based on Student ID)  
- 🗑️ Delete Student Record (based on Student ID)  
- ❌ Exit the program

## 🛠️ Features

- Uses `ArrayList` to store student data.
- Takes user input via `Scanner`.
- Student fields include:
  - 🆔 Student ID (Integer)
  - 📧 Email
  - 👤 Name
  - 🧮 Marks
- Validates inputs for Student ID and Marks.
- Uses `switch` statement and `try-catch` blocks for robust input handling.
